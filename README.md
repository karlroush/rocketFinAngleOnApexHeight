Abstract

This experiment was designed to investigate the effects of the fin angle on the peak vertical height of rockets, which was measured in meters. In this experiment, the data produced by a rocket with fins placed at 90 degrees from the body was considered the control group, while the data produced by the rocket with fins placed at 45 degree from the body was considered the test group. It was predicted that the rockets with fins placed at a 45 degree angle to the body would result in a significantly higher peak vertical flight height than the peak vertical flight height of rockets with fins placed at 90 degree angle to the body. In order to test this hypothesis, a model rocket with 90 degree fins was launched twelve times, and a model rocket with 45 degree fins was launched twelve times. Peak vertical flight height was measured by an altimeter that was attached to the rocket and produced data in meters. A one-tailed t-test was used to obtain a p-value in this investigation. The p-value was 9.99999999653x10-1, which was greater than the alpha of 0.05. These results have shown that rocket fins placed at a 45 degree angle to the body do not result in a significantly higher peak vertical flight height than the peak vertical flight height of fins placed at 90 degree angle to the body.
